            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that continuously records the changes made to a file or file sets over time so that in later versions the developer can see the steps made to get to the point that the file is at. Using a Version Control System is important for developers understanding in updating and further developing web pages. This topic is particularly interesting to me because I have always wondered how developers don’t repeat past mistakes made in projects that they are working on. This is relevant to the course because if we are studying to become sufficient developers we must understand a Version Control System.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began as an open source project with a ton of controversy and destruction. Git is also known as the Linux kernel and it is an open source software project that has quite a large scope. From 1991 to 2002 the files were discretely passed around as patches and archived files but in 2002 the Linuex kernel project began using a propriety DVCS called BitKeeper. The relationship between the two companies fell apart and Linuex had to redevelop their own program coined “Git.” This is important because in order to understand anything completely you must first understand how it came about and was developed. This is important to our class because we must fully understand Git in order to execute it properly. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">So what is Git? In this section we will discuss the basics of what Git does. Git is an example of a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System). Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes. This makes it so simple for developers to continue to develop on others works and improve software. This interests me because I have never quite understood how Git works but now I am learning. This is important to the class because we must understand these things in order to be able to use Git in the way it was intended. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Creating a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The most important thing to understand about Git is how to get a Git repository. You can either take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or you can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere. Either way there will be a Git repository on your local device. To begin controlling with Git you must go to your project and type “$ git init” This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files a Git repository skeleton. This interests me because you must know how to make a repository in order for git to be useful. This pertains to the class because it is the most crucial part of using git and this is what makes git what it is.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for millions of developers and projects. Most Git repositories are posted on GitHub to allow developers to review code, issue tracking, Git hosting, and other helpful activities. GitHub is an interactive community that allows developers to collaborate and improve each others coding and development skills. GitHub is like an online discussion board for all the coders. Signing up for GitHub is also free of charge and very easy to do. This interests me because the fact that I must sign up for a GitHub account it is important for me to know what GitHub is. This is very important for our class because this is where our code will be posted in order for collaboration.</p>
